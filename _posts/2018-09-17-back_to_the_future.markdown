I started developing software professionally in 1982 and spent the following thirty-plus years working in various parts of an incredible industry.  At the very beginning, as I approached graduation, I truly had no idea what was in store for me and I was, of course, worried.  Several of my professors had warned me that the typical software engineer would spend most of their career maintaining rusty old systems originally developed by others.  Severely plagued by early-adult angst, I fretted about my future life in this profession.  My mind conjured up dreary images of long days pouring over endless paper printouts struggling to decipher cryptic code developed years before by engineers much brighter than myself but that had moved on long ago leaving me cold and alone to keep their once beautiful creations running while I methodically shredded them into chaos with one ignorant patch after another.  

Happily, these anxious ruminations could not have been further from what I actually experienced. The software industry was positively booming and pushing itself into every area of the modern world.  I found greenfield projects wherever I turned along with talented co-workers and more senior mentors to guide me.  I discovered that any young developer with a reasonable amount of talent and dedication could find incredibly varied and exciting work and thrive.

I’ve been out of the industry now for four years and it’s been a wonderful time to try new things and refocus on areas of my life that I may have neglected.  Still, looking back, I find myself missing the challenges and rewards of software development.  I miss the teamwork and positive interaction that goes along with most development projects.  I also miss the necessary pressure to stay current and on top of evolving practices and tools.  Besides, producing a working piece of software that benefits the world (in any small way) is incredibly satisfying and well written software is nothing short of beautiful.  But, what I miss the most, perhaps, is the often overlooked opportunity for pure and absolute creativity that software development can provide.  

Although many of the fundamentals and principles of software design and development have remained the same, the industry seems to evolve ever more rapidly.   I have a strong sense that it is is still early-on; software is still becoming.   I’m heading back in.
