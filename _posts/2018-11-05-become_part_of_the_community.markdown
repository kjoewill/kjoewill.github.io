I’ve been thinking a lot recently about just how much the practice of software development has changed over the last 30 years as well as ways in which it fundamentally has not.

In the 80’s and well into the 90’s a developer’s primary resources were co-workers and books.  Today, I would argue that the internet is, by far,  the primary go-to resource programmers use when they need help.  The pattern and pace of resource usage has also changed.  Back in the dark ages my primary resource was definitely my peers at work but access was constrained by manners.  It’s hard to interrupt a cube-mate for help more than a few times day ... more than that can strain a relationship.  I look back on those days and contrast it with today where I might easily have hit the internet 30+ times in an hour looking for help!  This is incredible and much more efficient than requiring a sync in time with another person.  However, although I’d say 95% of my questions regarding development or usage of a particular technology can be found with a Google search, some problems are still best solved with help from another human.  In the distant past I would turn to a colleague for this type of help but today - and working from home - I’ll probably go ask the question on an online forum or answer site.

It's here that I have to smile because as much as things have changed ... so much has also remained the same.  I remember one of my first jobs right out of college with Northrop Aircraft.  This was in the 80’s and I was developing real time avionics software for military aircraft.  The brightest (and most intimidating) engineer on the floor was a middle-aged developer named John.  Whenever I could not see through a problem to a solution and grew tired of banging my head on the desk John was the person I turned to.  The problem was that John was a bit quirky and he would not suffer fools and took this to the point of refusing to help with poorly asked questions.  If my initial problem statement was ambiguous or meandering he would just say that he could not help and he’d then turn back to his own work.  I’d head back to my desk and labor with my problem until understood it better and could express it in a more succinct and hopefully John-acceptable way.  When I succeeded, Johns’ help was brilliant and freely given. I miss him.

I see similar behavior today on online answer sites such as Stack Overflow where senior members of the community will criticize poorly asked questions and vote them down or even block them.  Chastised askers have the opportunity to rephrase and improve their original question and when they do the community will re-engage to provide an answer.  Amazing!  Although the pace of the ask/answer cycle has greatly increased, there will always always be much value in a well-asked question.
