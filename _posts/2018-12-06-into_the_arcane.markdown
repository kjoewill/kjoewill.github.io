I recently began getting involved with StackOverflow ... a question/answer website that deals primarily with computer programing related topics.  Users can browser topic areas such as ‘ruby’, ‘javascript’, ‘rails’, etc.  There is a ton of content here with over 16 million questions asked on the site as of mid 2018!  

I’d been lurking here for years often finding answers to questions but never posting questions myself or answering any either for that matter.  I decided to change that and become more engaged by creating an account for myself.  With an account, users are allowed go beyond just browsing and actually ask and answer questions.  Points are awarded based on how the community reacts to your posts and as a user accumulates points (reputation) they receive additional privileges such as the ability to comment on questions, participate in chat sessions and, eventually, help moderate the site.  You can even earn badges!

Recently a question was asked related to a topic I am interested in ... the Ruby object model. The requester was asking how to determine if a particular object has a “singleton” which is how ruby objects store methods and instance variables that are specific to themselves.  I was able to do a little research into this arcane subject and come up with an answer and respond.  The requester was thankful but pointed out that mine was only a partial solution to his problem.  Undiscouraged, I resumed my research and actually posted a related question to the site (my first) and it was masterfully answered in less than an hour!  I was now able to revise my initial partial answer and repost.

My point here is that it is very worthwhile to join a community such as this and become engaged.  It almost seems too good to be true that you can can ask a technical question and receive expert advice in minutes.  In fact, sometimes, a small team of people will collaborate to help you find a solution.  This team will be rewarded by bolstering their reputations, increasing their knowledge and the receiving the gratification that comes from helping peers ... it’s definitely a win-win and truly amazing.
